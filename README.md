🌟 Welcome to the **JavaScript Pattern Drawing Program**! This project was developed as part of the **Programming Fundamentals with JavaScript** course at **Softuni**.

---

## 📖 Overview

This program is based on an initial framework provided by **Mario Zahariev**, my lecturer at Softuni. It is designed to help students practice JavaScript fundamentals, including:
- Loops
- User input handling
- Console-based interactions  

The program provides a menu where users can select a pattern type, specify dimensions, and display geometric patterns using asterisks (`*`).  

💡 **My Role:**  
I am responsible for completing the sections marked with `// TODO` comments by implementing the logic for drawing the patterns.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Right-angled Triangle  
- ✅ Square with Hollow Center  
- ✅ Diamond  
- ✅ Left-angled Triangle  
- ✅ Hollow Square  
- ✅ Pyramid  
- ✅ Reverse Pyramid  
- ✅ Rectangle with Hollow Center  

The program is interactive, allowing users to:
1. Select a pattern type from the menu.
2. Input the required dimensions (e.g., rows or width and height).
3. View the generated pattern in the console.

🖥️ Usage
Run the program and choose a pattern type by entering the number corresponding to the pattern.
Input the required dimensions when prompted.
View the generated pattern in the console.


📜 Attribution
Initial Code Framework:
The main structure and functionality, including the menu system and user input handling, were provided by Mario Zahariev, my lecturer at Softuni.

My Contribution:
I implemented the logic for drawing the patterns in the sections marked with // TODO.
