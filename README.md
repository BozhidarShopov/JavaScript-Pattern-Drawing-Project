🌟 Welcome to the **JavaScript Pattern Drawing Program**! This project was developed as part of the **Programming Fundamentals with JavaScript** course at **Softuni**.

---

## 📖 Overview

This program is based on an initial framework provided by **Mario Zahariev**, my lecturer at Softuni. It is designed to help students practice JavaScript fundamentals, including:
- Loops
- User input handling
- Console-based interactions  

The program provides a menu where users can select a pattern type, specify dimensions, and display geometric patterns using asterisks (`*`).  

💡 **My Role:**  
- I am responsible for completing the sections marked with `// TODO` comments by implementing the logic for drawing the patterns.
 - I am responsible for adding functionality to the original program 

---

✅ My Contribution:
- I implemented the logic for drawing the patterns in the sections marked with // TODO.
- I implemented the logic for adding an option for the user to choose a symbol from which the shapes are displayed.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Right-angled Triangle  
- ✅ Square with Hollow Center  
- ✅ Diamond  
- ✅ Left-angled Triangle  
- ✅ Hollow Square  
- ✅ Pyramid  
- ✅ Reverse Pyramid  
- ✅ Rectangle with Hollow Center  

The program is interactive, allowing users to:
1. Select a pattern type from the menu.
2. Input the required dimensions (e.g., rows or width and height).
3. View the generated pattern in the console.

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow these steps:
   - **Step 1:** Choose a pattern type by entering the number corresponding to the desired pattern:
     - `1` Right-angled Triangle  
     - `2` Square with Hollow Center  
     - `3` Diamond  
     - `4` Left-angled Triangle  
     - `5` Hollow Square  
     - `6` Pyramid  
     - `7` Reverse Pyramid  
     - `8` Rectangle with Hollow Center  
   - **Step 2:** Enter the required dimensions:
     - For most patterns, provide the number of rows.
     - For the rectangle pattern, provide both width and height.  
   - **Step 3:** View the generated pattern in the console.

3. You can restart the program by typing `y` when prompted, or exit by typing any other key.
